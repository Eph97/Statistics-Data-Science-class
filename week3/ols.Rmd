expected_wins <- read.csv('expected_wins.csv')
y <- expected_wins$TotalWins
x <- expected_wins$ExpectedWins
```

Fill in the function to calculate the betas for OLS.

Remember, we have a closed form expression for computing the betas in OLS: $\beta = (X'X)^{-1}X'y$

However, recall that to solve this in the vectorized form, we add a column of ones allowing us to compute the $\beta_0$ for the linear equation $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$. I've created a new matrix $W$ with this columns of ones so our new OLS formula becomes: $\beta = (W'W)^{-1}W'y$

```{r}
ols = function(y, ...){
	w <- cbind(1, ...)
  # Fill in missing code	
	return (betas=betas)
}

ols(y,x)
```

R comes with a built-in linear models function which we can check our own computed betas against.

```{r}
# regressing y on x
lm(TotalWins ~ ExpectedWins, data = expected_wins_nba)
```
